# Autonomous Driving Reinforcement Learning Platform

## Business Challenge Solved

**Pain Point:** Traditional autonomous vehicle development requires extensive manual programming of driving behaviors, leading to rigid systems that struggle with complex real-world scenarios and require months of development time for each new driving task.

**Architecture Implemented:** Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning system with residual CNN architecture, enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal driving policies through trial-and-error in realistic CARLA simulation environments.

**Results Achieved:** Developed a scalable RL framework that trains autonomous agents to navigate complex urban environments with 6 distinct driving actions, achieving continuous learning through 20,000-step replay memory and adaptive exploration strategies.
