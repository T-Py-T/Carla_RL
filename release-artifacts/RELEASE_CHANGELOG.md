SEQUENCE:
1. Create release artifact from tasks/ content
2. Generate summaries and metadata
3. Update changelog
4. Commit all changes
5. Create GitHub release
6. Upload release assets
7. Show summary
8. FINAL: Remove tasks/ folder (ready for next feature)

This guarantees no data loss and clean workspace for next feature.

REMOVED:
- release-artifacts/ folder (should be created by GitHub Action)
- RELEASE_CHANGELOG.md (should be created by GitHub Action)

CORRECT WORKFLOW:
1. Work in tasks/ folder during development
2. Merge PR triggers GitHub Action
3. GitHub Action creates release-artifacts/F001-feature-name/
4. GitHub Action creates RELEASE_CHANGELOG.md
5. GitHub Action cleans up tasks/ folder

The branch should only contain:
- tasks/ folder with working docs
- GitHub Action workflow

- Exclude virtual environments and build directories from syntax check
- Use minimal ruff rules to avoid conflicts with local development
- Local development remains slightly stricter than CI pipeline

* Improve device detection in PolicyWrapper

- Add safer device detection with proper error handling
- Handle cases where model has no parameters
- Add fallback to CPU device if detection fails
- Prevent StopIteration and AttributeError exceptions

* Split CI workflows into specialized files

- pr-checks.yml: Fast quality checks for PRs (syntax + basic linting)
- merge-validation.yml: Comprehensive validation for merges (tests + Docker + config)
- ml-pipeline-trigger.yml: ML pipeline automation (training/eval/deployment)
- security-scan.yml: Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- Updated README.md with comprehensive workflow documentation

Benefits:
- Separation of concerns for different workflow purposes
- Performance optimization (fast PR checks, comprehensive merge validation)
- Future-ready ML pipeline integration
- Security-first approach with regular scans
- Clear naming and maintainable structure

* Remove all emojis from workflow files and add strict no-emoji rule

- Removed all emojis from pr-checks.yml, merge-validation.yml, ml-pipeline-trigger.yml, security-scan.yml
- Created .cursor/rules/no-emojis.mdc with mandatory no-emoji policy
- All echo statements now use plain text
- Professional appearance maintained throughout

This ensures all future files will be emoji-free as requested.

* updates to readme and other scripting files.

* Fix deprecated GitHub Actions: Update upload-artifact to v4 and setup-uv to v4

- Updated actions/upload-artifact from v3 to v4 in security-scan.yml
- Updated astral-sh/setup-uv from v3 to v4 in all workflows
- Fixes security scan failure due to deprecated action versions

* Fix GitHub Action: Only trigger on release branch and move changelog to release-artifacts/

- Updated workflow to only trigger on merges to 'release' branch (not dev/staging)
- Moved RELEASE_CHANGELOG.md to release-artifacts/ folder to avoid root clutter
- Updated all references to point to release-artifacts/RELEASE_CHANGELOG.md

This prevents creating release artifacts on every merge and keeps all release-related files organized in the release-artifacts/ folder.

* removing artifacts from dev, they should only be in staging.

- Covers branch strategy, development workflow, and release management
- Includes commit standards, file organization rules, and best practices
- Set alwaysApply: true for consistent application across repositories
- Provides clear guidance for Cursor agents on proper GitHub operations

* Fix merge validation workflow pytest dependency issue

- Install dependencies for each component separately (model-serving, model-sim)
- Run pytest from within each component directory to use correct environment
- Add proper error handling and logging for test execution
- Ensures pytest is available in the correct virtual environment for each component

* Restructure CI workflows for proper PR validation

- Move comprehensive tests to PR-triggered merge-validation workflow
- Create lightweight branch-validation for push events
- Add PR information display for better context
- Create documentation for required status checks setup
- Ensures fast feedback on pushes, thorough validation on PRs
- Prevents merge until comprehensive tests pass

* Fix CI workflow performance and Docker warnings

- Replace while loops with find -exec for better performance and no hanging
- Fix Docker FROM statement casing warnings (as -> AS)
- Standardize user/group names to modelserving throughout Dockerfile
- Improve error handling and prevent runaway processes in CI
- Reduce CI execution time and eliminate Docker build warnings

* cleanup: update to layout
