# Feature Release: F001 - Add Model Serving

**Release ID:** `F001-add-model-serving`  
**Branch:** `add_model_serving`  
**Feature Number:** F001  
**Author:** Manual Test Release  
**Date:** 2025-09-27

## Description

This is the inaugural feature release implementing a complete Model Serving microservice for Highway RL. This release establishes the foundation for production-ready RL model deployment with comprehensive infrastructure and testing capabilities.

## Key Components Delivered

### 1. Model Serving Microservice (`model-serving/`)
- **FastAPI Application**: Production-ready REST API for model inference
- **Docker Containerization**: Multi-stage builds with security best practices
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Tested on local OrbStack cluster
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and QA validation suites

### 2. Repository Reorganization
- **Function-driven Structure**: Clean separation of concerns
- **model-sim/**: Simulation and training components (Highway RL focused)
- **model-serving/**: Production serving infrastructure
- **tasks/**: Project management and documentation

### 3. GitHub Actions Automation
- **Feature Release Artifacts**: Automated documentation preservation
- **Structured Naming**: F001-feature-name convention
- **Release Management**: Professional GitHub releases with artifacts

### 4. Legacy Cleanup
- **Removed CARLA Dependencies**: Focused on Highway RL only
- **Streamlined Codebase**: Eliminated unused legacy components
- **Updated Documentation**: Consistent Highway RL branding

## Technical Achievements

- ✅ **Production-Ready API**: `/healthz`, `/metadata`, `/predict`, `/warmup` endpoints
- ✅ **Containerized Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes with resource limits
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 55+ sub-tasks completed across 5 major sections
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Function-driven organization pattern
- ✅ **Automated Workflows**: GitHub Actions for release management

## Files Changed

This feature touched virtually every aspect of the repository:
- Complete model serving implementation (40+ files)
- Repository reorganization (30+ files moved)
- GitHub Actions automation (2 new workflow files)
- Documentation updates throughout
- Legacy code removal and cleanup

## Next Steps

With F001 complete, the foundation is established for:
- F002: Enhanced model evaluation and benchmarking
- F003: Advanced deployment features (auto-scaling, monitoring)
- F004: Multi-model serving capabilities

## Validation

This release has been thoroughly tested:
- ✅ Docker deployment and container functionality
- ✅ Kubernetes deployment on OrbStack cluster
- ✅ API endpoint validation and error handling
- ✅ Repository structure and organization
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow functionality

---

This release represents a significant milestone in establishing a professional, production-ready Highway RL serving platform.
