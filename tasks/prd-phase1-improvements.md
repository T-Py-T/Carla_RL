# Product Requirements Document: Phase 1 Policy-as-a-Service Improvements

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines comprehensive improvements to the existing Policy-as-a-Service implementation to meet all Phase 1 requirements for production-ready RL model serving. The current implementation provides a solid foundation but requires enhancements in performance validation, artifact management, configuration handling, and monitoring to achieve the target P50 < 10ms latency and enterprise-grade reliability.

**Problem Statement**: The current implementation lacks performance validation on real hardware, comprehensive artifact integrity checking, proper semantic versioning enforcement, and production monitoring capabilities required for reliable RL model serving in production environments.

**Goal**: Transform the existing Policy-as-a-Service into a production-ready system that meets all Phase 1 requirements with validated performance metrics, robust artifact management, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Goals

1. **Performance Validation**: Achieve and validate P50 < 10ms latency on target hardware with comprehensive benchmarking
2. **Artifact Integrity**: Implement robust hash pinning and semantic versioning for reliable model deployment
3. **Configuration Management**: Provide flexible environment + file-based configuration with validation
4. **Production Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive metrics, logging, and observability
5. **Hardware Optimization**: Add platform-specific optimizations for CPU/GPU inference
6. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive README with performance metrics and deployment guides

## User Stories

### As a ML Engineer
- I want to validate that my RL model achieves P50 < 10ms latency on production hardware so that I can ensure real-time performance
- I want to deploy models with semantic versioning (v1.2.3) so that I can manage model rollbacks and A/B testing
- I want to verify artifact integrity using hash pinning so that I can ensure model consistency across deployments

### As a DevOps Engineer
- I want to configure the service using environment variables and config files so that I can manage different deployment environments
- I want to monitor service performance and health through Prometheus metrics so that I can detect issues proactively
- I want to see structured logs for debugging so that I can troubleshoot production issues quickly

### As a System Administrator
- I want to deploy the service with hardware-specific optimizations so that I can maximize performance on available infrastructure
- I want to validate that the service meets performance requirements before production deployment
- I want comprehensive documentation so that I can understand deployment and configuration options
