## Next Steps for Empirical Testing

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd model-serving
./scripts/setup_benchmarking.sh
```

### 2. Run System Analysis
```bash
python3 scripts/collect_system_info.py --analysis --output system_info.json
```

### 3. Run Performance Benchmarks
```bash
# Quick test (5-10 minutes)
python3 scripts/local_benchmark.py --quick --output quick_benchmark.json

# Comprehensive test (30-60 minutes)
python3 scripts/local_benchmark.py --comprehensive --output comprehensive_benchmark.json
```

### 4. Analyze Results
```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_benchmarks.py comprehensive_benchmark.json --output performance_report.txt
```

### 5. Run Complete Suite
```bash
./scripts/run_full_benchmark_suite.sh
```
